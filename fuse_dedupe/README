Base FUSE system is designed by Prof. Pfeiffer (http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~pfeiffer/fuse-tutorial/).

The data deduplication for FUSE is in three parts, first part is Metafile implementation, second is SHA1 ID generating for each chunk file/data, third is modification of the READ/WRITE/Get_attribute operations of FUSE.

I implemented the Metafile read/write/delete operations, and involved in the final system debug.
